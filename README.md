# Static Site Generator - rohan-ssg.js
## Overview
This tool enables the user to:

  1. Specify a ".txt" or ".md" file to have it converted into an HTML webpage.
  2. Specify a folder containing multiple ".txt" and ".md" files to convert all of them into HTML web pages. The program will recursively search subfolders for ".txt" files as well. 

For markdown files, we currently support proper styling syntax features for italics, bold, heading 1, heading 2, and a link.

NOTE: This tool requires the use of a BASH shell.


## Installation
To install this program, first `git clone` the repository. 

Then open a terminal inside of the newly created folder, and run `npm install` to install the node dependencies.

Then, in the same folder run `npm install -g` to globally install the command line tool. 

This command will install the programming globally on your system.

## Usage

### Current Version

To check the current version of the program, the user can run:

`rohan-ssg -v` or `rohan-ssg --version`

Which will output:

`The current version is: x.x.x`

### Help
To see a message explaining the program, the user can run:

`rohan-ssg -h` or `rohan-ssg --help`

Which will output:
```
This program is used to generate a static HTML web page from a given .txt file OR a folder containing .txt files.
The following options are available: 
    -v, --version: current program version
    -h, --help: program instructions
    -i, --input: path input folder or file to be converted to HTML. Note that folders are recursively searched for .txt and .md files.
    -s, --stylesheet: stylesheet url to be used in the HTML file
    
    The files will be saved in a '/dist' folder in the same directory as the input file/folder.

    For example, to generate a single HTML file from a .txt file with a specific stylesheet URL, use the following command:
    rohan-ssg -i .PATH/TO/FILE/input.txt -s https://example.com/stylesheet.css
```

### Input (with and without stylesheet)

For a specific file, the user can run:

`rohan-ssg -i PATH/TO/FILE/example.txt` or `rohan-ssg --input PATH/TO/FILE/example.txt` or `rohan-ssg --input PATH/TO/FILE/example.md`

This will then generate a `/dist` directory, containing the HTML file that had been generated.

For a folder:

`rohan-ssg -i PATH/TO/FOLDER` or `rohan-ssg --input PATH/TO/FOLDER`

Similar to above, this will also generate a `/dist` directory, which will contain all of the HTML files that had been generated from all of the .txt and .md files inside of the specified folder (including subfolders). 

To specify a stylesheet to be applied to all HTML files, the user can choose to use the `-s` or `--stylesheet` option as follows:

`rohan-ssg -i PATH/TO/FOLDER -s https://example.com/stylesheet.css` or `rohan-ssg -i PATH/TO/FILE/example.txt -s https://example.com/stylesheet.css`

This will link the specified stylesheet (which must be a url) to all HTML files that have been generated.
